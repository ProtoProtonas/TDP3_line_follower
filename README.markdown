Code for line following robot of Team Design Project 3 module


This is a code for Team Design Project 3 module in my 3rd year at University of Glasgow.
The aim of the project is to make a robot that can pick up a metal disc and carry it around the track (black line on a white-ish surface). The task is both hardware and software based. 

Our team of six people had to design and make circuits for all of the functions of the robot - driving the motors, detecting the line, detecting the colour of the disc, solenoid (which is what we use to pick up and drop the disc) control board and the main PCB to house NXP's Freedom KL25Z microcontroller.
